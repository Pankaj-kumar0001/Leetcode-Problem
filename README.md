📝 Example Problem and Solution
Problem: Two Sum
Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Example: Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]

Solution:

vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    unordered_map<int, int> seen;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (seen.count(complement)) {
            return {seen[complement], i};
        }
        seen[nums[i]] = i;
    }
    return {};
}
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
